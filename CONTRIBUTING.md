# How to translate

There are multiple ways to add or edit your translation of the game:

* via the GitHub web editor [\[jump\]](#using-the-github-web-editor)
* by downloading and editing an archive of the repository [\[jump\]](#using-a-repository-archive)
* by forking the Git repository, editing your fork, and then submitting a pull request [\[jump\]](#using-a-github-fork)

## Using the GitHub web editor

0. Ensure you are [logged in](https://github.com/login) to GitHub.

1. Open the [GitHub web editor](https://github.dev/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_translations) by clicking on this link.

2. When prompted, install the suggested extension.

   ![Recommended Extensions tooltip, suggesting the installation of "Valve KeyValue File Support".](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210736839-3e297a14-59bd-4296-8673-25e3e25b6648.png)

3. Use the File Explorer panel on the left to find a file to translate.

   ![The File Explorer activity sidebar.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210736894-3f82846d-2c7c-4747-bb7d-ecbe0612c8c3.png)

4. Find some untranslated lines â€“ compared to the translated ones, they are **indented with two tabs**!

   ![Two lines to translate, with an orange square emphasising the indentation.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210736935-643c5e14-7fca-46b0-8924-c45b734359ad.png)  
   You can find all of them at once through searching with the regex `^\t\t` like this:  
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652463/213093897-08f6b1c3-7cc3-47d3-bb13-a383ca8ef17b.png)


5. Translate the lines, paying attention to not remove the quotes `"` at the start and at the end of the string.
   Don't edit the lines starting with `[english]`: they're just there to provide some context for the translation!

   ![The previous two lines are now translated into Italian.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210737245-7fd57508-908b-47fe-9c14-040e8a8e2ac1.png)

6. Outdent (remove the indentation from) the now-translated lines.  
   If you have many lines, you can select them all and then press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd>!

   ![outdent](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652463/213098425-3cd2a854-cf2b-4846-b1e1-fa8c48db4cfb.gif)


7. Once you've translated enough lines, open the Source Control panel on the left.

   ![The Source Control activity sidebar.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210737455-72f3c2b8-200e-44a7-ae93-5e5aa0d4f8e6.png)

8. You will be prompted to enter a message describing your changes; add the name of the language you translated strings to between parenthesis, then describe very briefly what these strings are related to.
   
   For example, a good message might be `(italian) Translate Steam Rich Presence strings`.

   ![The Source Control activity sidebar, now having "(italian) Translate Steam Rich Presence strings" as commit message.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210737513-06935053-f900-4b4d-9ba2-0ca19a67ee4c.png)

9. Create a new **pull request** by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> while the cursor is in the message box.
   
   If it's your first time submitting translations, you might be prompted to *fork* the repository: please do so!
   
   ![Window prompting to fork the repository, with a orange 9 suggesting to press the "Fork Repository" button.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210737549-06ebede8-10c9-451d-a5bf-20b916f67b9f.png)

   You'll then be prompted to enter the title of the pull request, which will be pre-filled with the message you entered earlier; press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to continue.

   ![Window prompting to enter a pull request title, with "(italian) Translate Steam Rich Presence strings" prefilled.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210737584-03186854-4697-49ad-b889-be013618b605.png)

   You will also be prompted to enter a branch name; leave whatever the editor suggested unchanged, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> again.

   ![Window prompting to enter a branch name, with "patch-1" prefilled.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210737617-0ec6fc32-e569-44a8-8ec0-2862982cb497.png)

10. Done! Your translation should now appear in the [list of pull requests of the repository](https://github.com/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_translations/pulls), and can be approved, edited, or rejected!

    ![List of the open pull requests of the ReactiveDrop repository, displaying 1 open with the title "(italian) Translate Steam Rich Presence strings".](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1540885/210737654-9525a62b-a4ae-46b9-ae83-12e7b73e5e67.png)

## Using a repository archive

[Download](https://github.com/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_translations/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the repository, edit it on your computer and then submit it through the [Issues tab](https://github.com/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_translations/issues) by providing an archive.

## Using a GitHub fork

[Fork the repository](https://github.com/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_translations/fork), edit & commit it, then push your changes back to the origin.

Use an editor to make your changes and integrate them through github. Read more about it [on our wiki](https://github.com/ReactiveDrop/reactivedrop_translations/wiki).

### Pre-requisites
- Any unicode plain text editor. Eg. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- An [GIT installation](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Files

## File Encoding
Make sure your text editor preserves file encodings.  
New files need to have same encoding as their english counterparts (eg. labsmail1_czech.txt needs to be UTF-8 encoded just like labsmail1_english.txt). If you use Notepad++ you can see the file's encoding in the menu Encoding. vscode shows the files encoding in its status bar.

## File type
### Achievements
These files are automatically created based on the `resource/reactivedrop_*.txt` files. You can manually trigger an update of the files through executing `utils/translation-sync-tool.exe`.
* sync-tool: Very useful verification tool!
 1. It can help solving issues with ci-checks. After having manually modified the content of achievements, it is highly recommended to let the tool check for problems.
 2. It can automatically synchronize achievement fields from `reactivedrop_*.txt` to `563560_loc_*.vdf`. This can be very useful to avoid the time-consuming task of comparing duplicated work.

### Mail and News
Create a copy of each mail and news file, and replace the language suffix, eg. `labsmail1_russian.txt`. Translate the contents of each file. See labsmail1_russian.txt as an example.

### BaseModUi, CloseCaption, GameUi, ReactiveDrop, and Community VDF files
In these files(eg. basemodui_czech.txt) the untranslated strings are indented by two tabs to be easily visible. Translate each indented line and remove the two tabs in front of it.

### Workshop
Create a copy of the English file and rename it to your language suffix (eg. workshop_tags_schinese.json). Translate the contents of the file. In JSON files, only translate text on the right side of the colon `:`.

### Item Schema
Duplicate lines with an `_english` suffix and rename them according to your language. Keep each block of translations in alphabetical order by language name. If there are words between `%percent_signs%`, leave them as-is (they are replaced with numbers in the game later). Don't change any lines that aren't suffixed with a language name.

## Changing English strings
If you change an English string in a way that does not require editing other languages (such as fixing a typo that doesn't change the meaning), you'll need to also change the `[english]` copy of the string in each of the other language files too (for positive ci-checks later on). The sync-tool will do the hard work for you. Start it after you've made your change in the english file. 

## How to test your translation before submitting it
First of all, Go to Steam > Library > Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop, right click and choose 'Properties'.
1. At 'General': Select the language you are translating into.
2. At 'Betas': Opt into the beta. This is recommended especially if you're translation recently added content.
3. At 'Installed Files': Click 'Browse...' to open your game folder.
4. Enter the subfolders '.\reactivedrop\resource', like: `Steam\steamapps\common\Alien Swarm Reactive Drop\reactivedrop\resource`
5. Copy your translated files into their respective folders (.\resource).
6. Now you can start the game and test your translation :D

- ATTENTION: Every file in the resource folder is UTF-16LE encoded, whereas all files in this repo are UTF-8 encoded. You may need to change the encoding of the files before you copy them over.
